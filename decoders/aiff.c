/*
 * AIFF decoder for SDL_sound
 *
 * [Insert something profound about the AIFF file format here.]
 *
 * This code was ripped from a decoder I had written for SDL_mixer, which was
 * based on SDL_mixer's old AIFF music loader. (This loader was unfortunately
 * completely broken, but it was still useful because all the pieces were
 * still there, so to speak.)
 *
 * When rewriting it for SDL_sound, I changed its structure to be more like
 * the WAV loader Ryan wrote. Had they not both been part of the same project
 * it would have been embarrassing how similar they are.
 *
 * It is not the most feature-complete AIFF loader the world has ever seen.
 * For instance, it only makes a token attempt at implementing the AIFF-C
 * standard; basically the parts of it that I can easily understand and test.
 * It's a start, though.
 *
 * Please see the file LICENSE in the source's root directory.
 *
 *  This file was written by Torbjörn Andersson. (d91tan@Update.UU.SE)
