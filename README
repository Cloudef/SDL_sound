SDL_sound. An abstract soundfile decoder.

Check here, until I get to write more of this README:

   http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/

Unix, BeOS, MacOS X, BSD users:
   If you pulled from CVS, run "./bootstrap" first.
   Then, run ./configure with your favorite options, "make", "make install".

Win32 users:
   Download http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/downloads/SDL_sound_win32.zip and
   unzip it in the root of the source tree (the directory with SDL_sound.c,
   etc). This will give you Visual C++ project files and some other needed
   code.

There will be a shared library and a binary called "playsound".
