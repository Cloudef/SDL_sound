SDL_sound. An abstract soundfile decoder.

Check here, until I get to write more of this README:
   http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/

SDL_sound _REQUIRES_ Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) to function, and cannot
 be built without it. You can get SDL from http://www.libsdl.org/. SDL_sound
 has only been tried with the SDL 1.2 series, but may work on older versions.
 Reports of success or failure are welcome.

Some optional external libraries that SDL_sound can use and where to find them:
 SMPEG (used to decode MP3s): http://www.lokigames.com/development/smpeg.php3
 libvorbis (used to decode OGGs): http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/
 libFLAC (used to decode FLACs): http://flac.sourceforge.net/
 libModPlug (used to decode MODs, etc): http://modplug-xmms.sourceforge.net/
 libMikMod (used to decode MODs, etc, too): http://www.mikmod.org/

These external libraries are OPTIONAL. SDL_sound will build and function
 without them, but various sound file formats are not supported unless these
 libraries are available. Unless explicitly disabled during initial build
 configuration, SDL_sound always supports these file formats internally:

 - Microsoft .WAV files (uncompressed and MS-ADPCM encoded).
 - Creative Labs .VOC files
 - Shorten (.SHN) files
 - Audio Interchange format (AIFF) files
 - Sun Audio (.AU) files
 - MIDI files
 - Raw waveform data


Building/Installing:

MacOS X users:
   If you want to use the command line tools, read the next section. If you
   prefer to use PowerBuilder, download this file:
    http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/downloads/PBProjects.tar.gz
   ...and extract it into your SDL_sound directory. The PowerBuilder project
   files include several of the external libraries, whereas you will have to
   find and install those libraries yourself with the command line tools.

MacOS 9 users:
   Included with the source is CWProject.sit, which contains project files for
   CodeWarrior 5.0 and later.

Linux, Unix, BeOS, MacOS X command line, BSD users:
   If you pulled from CVS, run "./bootstrap" first.
   Then, run ./configure with your favorite options, "make", "make install".

Win32 users:
   Download http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/downloads/SDL_sound_win32.zip and
   unzip it in the root of the source tree (the directory with SDL_sound.c,
   etc). This will give you Visual C++ project files and some other needed
   code.

There will be a shared library and a binary called "playsound".


Reporting bugs/commenting:
 There is a mailing list available. To subscribe, send a blank email to
 sdlsound-subscribe@icculus.org. This is the best way to get in touch with
 SDL_sound developers.
