Building is very easy.


ALL PLATFORMS:

Please understand your rights and mine: read the text file COPYING in the root
of the source tree. If you can't abide by it, delete this source tree now.

The best documentation for the SDL_sound API is SDL_sound.h. It is VERY
heavily commented, and makes an excellent, in-depth reference to all the
functions.


UNIX:

(If you pulled the source from CVS), run ./bootstrap

run ./configure --help, and see if there's any options you need. Rerun 
configure with those options. If this is confusing to you, just run 
./configure with no options: the defaults are generally decent, and 
configure is usually smart enough to figure out what's best..

If configuration succeeded, run "make".

Run "make install" as root to install the library for use on your system.

This should work for most Unix-style systems, including Linux, *BSD, and 
MacOS X. Reports of success and failure are welcome.


WIN32:
Download http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/downloads/SDL_sound_win32.zip ...
Unzip that file in the root of the source directory. That will give you 
some needed external libraries, and Visual C++ project files. Use the 
project files to compile.


OTHER PLATFORMS:

Send me patches, and instructions, and I'll list them here. Consider 
joining the SDL_sound mailing list. Details are at:
