General stuff TODO:
- Verify portability to various Unixes (BSD, etc)
- Port to BeOS.
- Port to MacOS Classic.
- Man pages for the API.
- Add Sound_Rewind().

More immediate:
- Write a decent README.
- Handle compression and other chunks in WAV files.
- Handle compression and other chunks in AIFF-C files.
- Cleanup up VOC decoder (seems messy to me).
- Rename "test" directory to "playsound".
- Have default make build playsound, and make install install it.
- Make some of the SNDDBG() strings more uniform.
- Run through ElectricFence, dmalloc, etc...
- Verify thread safety. SDL_sound should be fully reentrant right now, with
  the exception of Sound_NewSample*()...starting two sounds at once can cause
  the internal linked list of currently-decoding samples to scramble.

Decoders to implement:
- .CDA (Does this need specific decoding? Or is a RWops needed?)
- An mpglib MP3 decoder? (or backend mpglib into SMPEG?)
- ...and more...

Ongoing:
- look for "FIXME"s in the code.
