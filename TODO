General stuff TODO:
- Verify portability to various Unixes (BSD, etc)
- Port to BeOS.
- Port to MacOS Classic.
- Man pages for the API.
- Add Sound_Rewind().

More immediate:
- Write a decent README.
- Handle compression and other chunks in WAV files.
- Handle compression and other chunks in AIFF-C files.
- Cleanup up VOC decoder (seems messy to me).
- Rename "test" directory to "playsound".
- Have default make build playsound, and make install install it.
- Make some of the SNDDBG() strings more uniform.
- Shrink buffer in Sound_DecodeAll to fit exact size of sample after decoding.
- Make Sound_SetError() and Sound_GetError() use their own buffers, so they
  don't piddle over SDL errors, and vice-versa.
- Run through ElectricFence, dmalloc, etc...

Decoders to implement:
- .CDA (Does this need specific decoding? Or is a RWops needed?)
- An mpglib MP3 decoder? (or backend mpglib into SMPEG?)
- ...and more...

Ongoing:
- look for "FIXME"s in the code.
