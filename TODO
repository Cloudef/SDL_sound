More immediate (needed for 1.0 release):
- Man pages. Doxygen would be cool.
- Handle compression and other chunks in WAV files.
- Handle compression and other chunks in AIFF-C files.
- Cleanup up VOC decoder (seems messy to me).
- Fix the crappy rewind implementation in shn.c's SHN_rewind().
- Finish implementing seek() method in decoders, see below.
- Add a sdlsound-config script?
- playsound is a little wonky when specifying only --rate (or only --channel
  or only --format? Look into this.).

Decoders still needing seek() method:
  (If decoder can't seek, clean up the stub and report an error.)
- mikmod.c
- shn.c
- mpglib.c
- quicktime.c

General stuff TODO:
- Man pages for the API.
- Hack on the experimental audio conversion routines.

Quicktime stuff that'd be cool, but isn't crucial:
- Integrate decoders/quicktime.c with build system (for OS X)?
- Make decoders/quicktime.c more robust.
- Make decoders/quicktime.c work on win32?
- There's no seek() method.

Ongoing:
- look for "FIXME"s in the code.
